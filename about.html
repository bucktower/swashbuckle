<p>My name is <a href="https://bucktower.net">Buck Tower</a> and this is Swashbuckle. ðŸ¦‘ This is Squishy the Swashbuckle Squid, the mascot.</p>

<hr/>

<h5>Why does this exist?</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Swashbuckle Studios LLC is a catch-all legal entity that I can use to register a bank account, Stripe account, etc to use in my personal projects</li>
  <li>I'd like a sort-of blog where I go into more of the meta of my projects, both music and tech and honestly whatever else I make</li>
</ul>

<h5>Why ðŸ¦‘?</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Having a mascot is fun</li>
  <li>"Swashbuckle" gives a piratey vibe. Squids and krakens give a piratey vibe.</li>
</ul>

<h5>How can I join up and work on one of your projects with you?</h5>
<ul>
  <li>There's a nice <b>Contact</b> button up top in the right</li>
</ul>

<h5>What sort of projects do you work on?</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Web apps</li>
  <li>Mobile apps</li>
  <li>Games</li>
  <li>Songs</li>
  <li>Graphics</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>
