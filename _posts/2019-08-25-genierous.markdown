ðŸ§ž Genierous is an on-demand gift delivery service to make it easy to gift-give anywhere with the tap of a finger.

Genierous provides anyone an easy way to send gifts on-demand to friends, family members, or even distant relatives. Via Postmates' third-party delivery service, we organize, schedule, and execute timely in-person gift deliveries for local products in far-away places ranging from native flowers from a local florist to some fresh-baked cookies in a distant city's highest-rated hometown bakery.

Edible arrangements are the gift-giving equivalent of a Honda Civic. By no means are generic gift bad! However, gifts are much more meaningful with personalization, and, well, a personalization and delivery that say to a recipient that you spent a bit more effort and time than a 5-minute phone call with the cheapest nationwide gift packaging company. Generic gifts are safe and inoffensive, which might be the right thing to give if you barely know someone, but they say very little about a relationship whereas gift-giving is one of the best opportunities to let someone know how much you really know and appreciate them. 

With Genierous, gift-giving is much more personalized, yet also streamlined and efficient. After coordinating with a local place of business such as a bakery for a set pickup time, Genierous collects from the "giver" the "getter"'s name, address, and phone number. Genierous then is able to coordinate a pickup and in-person delivery after confirming a good delivery time and address for an incoming package with the getter, all easily trackable to completion by the giver who may be thousands of miles away.

To get started, download the Genierous app and give a gift to someone you might not easily see in person on a daily basis.

Given that delivery services and gifts are both getting cheaper and more commonplace, Genierous provides a way to harness technology and on-demand services for a purpose other than purely helping oneself like Amazon Prime or GrubHub.
