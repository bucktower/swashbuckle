ðŸ§± Buildarium is a creative building experience that connects real life building sets with an infinite virtual universe.

The buildarium ecosystem consists of both physical and digital parts. Upon buying a kit, users have the ability to 3D print their own interlocking building blocks or use are print-and-ship service. Upon building the set, users are able to give it life beyond a dusty shelf by activating it via an in-app NFC scan. The Buildarium Universe is a sandbox-like RTS/FPS game structured around planets and solar systems where users collect resources and build a civilization often with their friends.

Besides a hefty price tag, building blocks like LEGOs often have a very short lifespan as a toy and are most likely to sit on a shelf and gather dust for eternity after being initially built. Similarly, video sandbox games like Minecraft, Halo Reach Forge mode, and Roblox offer an ever-changing landscape but lack the centrality, quality control, and connectedness to effectively facilitate multiplayer experiences, and often end up repetitive as a result.

In harnessing 3D printing, Buildarium offers unlimited space for modifications to the physical side, while still providing a shelf life longer than a week with the digital Buildarium Universe at a cheaper price than conventional building sets. Additionally, in being fundamentally centered around multiplayer, Buildarium makes playing with friends much more accessible, while offering a more streamlined process to include user-generated content into both worlds.

To get started, visit buildarium.com and open an account. The first step towards building a Buildarium civilization would be purchasing, building, and activating the Homestead Kit.

Buildarium aims to bring the building sets and sandbox games of yesteryear into the modern day. We aim to do this by marrying both the physical and digital creative worlds, and reaping the maximum benefits of both, such as infinite building possibilities, user-generated content, and procedurally-generated ever-expanding universes.
